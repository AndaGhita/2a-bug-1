Find and correct the bug, then propose a change (pull request).


This software is supposed to be in a Airline optimization software ...
but the test code, which is named 2a-bug-1.c shows the code to set the flight path does not work!

The software should print "flight.path=GOT-CPH" but it doesn't!

Help!
